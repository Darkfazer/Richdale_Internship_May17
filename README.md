# 🚀 AI Internship Test: Deploying an Image Classifier on Minikube

## 📌 Introduction & Objective  
Welcome to the AI Internship technical test! This test evaluates candidates' **practical knowledge** in AI model deployment, Kubernetes, and infrastructure handling beyond theoretical concepts.  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
Candidates will develop and deploy an **image classification model** using **MobileNet**, containerize it with **Docker**, and run it on **Minikube**, along with a **basic UI** for interaction.

---

## 🛠️ **Project Overview**  
### 🔹 **Task**  
Candidates must develop a **lightweight image classification model**, deploy it inside a **containerized API**, and integrate a **basic UI for image upload and prediction**, all running on **Minikube**.

### 🔹 **Key Components**  
1️⃣ **MobileNet Model** → Pre-trained CNN optimized for lightweight classification  
2️⃣ **Containerization** → Dockerized API for serving model predictions  
3️⃣ **Kubernetes Deployment** → Minikube cluster management and scaling  
4️⃣ **Simple Web UI** → User-friendly image upload interface  

---

## ✅ **Project Steps & Expected Deliverables**  
### 📌 **Phase 1: AI Model & API Development**  
🔹 Load and use MobileNet for image classification  
🔹 Develop a **REST API** (FastAPI or Flask) to expose predictions  
🔹 Ensure correct image processing and response formatting  

### 📌 **Phase 2: Containerization & Minikube Setup**  
🔹 Write a **Dockerfile** to package the application  
🔹 Deploy the containerized model **inside Minikube** (Kubernetes Deployment & Service)  
🔹 Test scalability by simulating multiple requests  

### 📌 **Phase 3: UI Integration & Testing**  
🔹 Create a **basic web UI** to allow users to upload images  
🔹 Connect UI to the backend API for real-time classification  
🔹 Ensure the system runs smoothly under different workloads
